## About The Project üìñ
<img src="src/img/repo/react-basics-classes-add-to-cart.png" alt="app demo" style="margin: 20px 0">

Clicking the Add to Cart button the product that was clicked will be added to the shopping cart.

By default, the shopping cart will be empty.

Once a product has been added to the cart you should be able to:

- Edit the product quantity using the select element which will update the cart‚Äôs total price
- Remove items from the cart which will update the cart‚Äôs total price
- The cart total price always will be updated so that it represents the total cost of all the items in the cart
- When the cart is empty will be render a message inside the cart saying that the cart is empty. Then, when the cart has had items added, instead will be render the cart items and remove the default message.
- If the cart item has already been added to the cart will be only updated the quantity instead of adding it again.
- The quantity should not be larger than 10 units for each product when try to added more than that will be display a error message
- Items will be stored in local storage and load them if the page is reloaded so that the cart items are not lost of page refresh
